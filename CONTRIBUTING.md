# How To Contribute

## Reporting Bugs

1. Ensure the bug was not already reported by checking the [open issues](https://github.com/Pageworks/papertrain/issues)
2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem [open a new issue](https://github.com/Pageworks/papertrain/issues/new)
3. Provide relevant information about the bug including a title, clear description, and code samples when possible

## Requesting Features

1. Provide a title, clear description, code samples, graphics (flow charts, wireframes, etc), or external references in order to help others understand what you're requesting
2. Actively engage in discussion with others

Once a feature has been researched and discussed a milestone will be assigned. The milestone will determine if the feature will be branched off of the `develop` branch or a long term `wip/` branch.

## Pull Requests

1. Pull the current development branch or the new version you wish to contribute towards
2. Create a new branch using the applicable naming convention:
    - `hotfix/branch-name` for bug fixes
    - `feature/branch-name` for features
    - `wip/papertrain-0.x` for new versions
3. Do the work
4. Commit your changes using the closing issues keyword
    - `Closes #XXX - brief description of changes`
4. Submit a PR merging your branch into `develop`
